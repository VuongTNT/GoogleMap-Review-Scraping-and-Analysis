When we did have the windows open to try and keep it cool, the noise level from the cars was astronomical and it seemed to go on all night. There was also a strange rattling noise coming from the kitchen window directly under ours which seemed to continue into the early hours of the morning (like someone was banging against the window). The bed was comfortable but in hindsight of everything else, it didn’t really matter because we couldn’t sleep anyway. We had a really long day on the Saturday so only having 3 or 4 hours sleep the night before wasn’t great. Whilst I know I could have mentioned these things during our stay, I fully understand that they’re a pub not a 5* hotel. Aside from all of the above, the staff were very friendly, the food was great and the location is beautiful.
