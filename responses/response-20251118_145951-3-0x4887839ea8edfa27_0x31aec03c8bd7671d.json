Waited 5 minutes for someone to come over to take an order after trying to order at the till - advised it was table service. Then waited another 13 minutes for 2 coffees. Table next to us also had to enquire if someone would take an order as it was taking some time.  When ordering, we were asked if sugar was required, 2 sachets where placed on the table....no wee dish of selection. It was 2 white sugars just on the table 🤦‍♀️. Could have been put on the saucer?\nThere was a steady flow of customers but not that it felt busy. Really disappointed 😞 ☕️"
