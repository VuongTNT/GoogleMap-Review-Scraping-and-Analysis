The waitress came over to take our order, seemed confused when we said as a party we wanted to order separately, we ordered our food and drinks which they asked so many questions it was very awkward. After 15 minutes none of us had received drinks. When questioned this she went into kitchen and said. So sorry your slipped gone under something. They are coming now.\nWe ordered a milk shake at £6.50! Yep £6.50 it came in a pint bottle and a straw! That was it, nothing special just milk with vanilla flavouring. extortionate !! Cans of pop were £2.50 each ! Coke came in a  small glass bottle at £2.50!\nBreakfast was £12.50, 2 sausages, 2bacon, 2 eggs, black pudding and toast. The toast was the end of a loaf of bread, dry and cold. The remainder was ok this took almost 30 minutes. Our friends food came out another 10 minutes later.\nMug of black coffee was £3.00 this was instant coffee in a mug.\nThe older lady who served the food had no smile. She Reached over my husband’s food to place another plate down. She told our friend to not talk on the phone and reminded him he was in a restaurant even though it was a\nSmall cafe in a community center.\n\nWhen we left there was no bye from any of the staff when we said bye and thank you.\n\nSadly we would never return to this cafe. Yes it’s the only one for miles on The NC500 you would thought they would be much more welcoming !!!",
