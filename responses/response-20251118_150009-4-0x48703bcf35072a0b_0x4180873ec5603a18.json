The crowd was exactly the sort you would expect, loud, flash, and clearly spending beyond their means, nice new cars on finance and outfits courtesy of ASOS bought on Klarna, all very ‘look at me’. It felt more like a festival of egos than anything else. A very hyper-extroverted crowd of people for sure. Bit sad, really, because the cider itself is genuinely lovely. I picked up a bottle of the Perry and it was fantastic, really high quality, organic too, which I love.\n\nBeyond the cider, the shop is sweet, nice produce, bit on the pricey side but goes with the territory.\n\nI’d absolutely buy the cider again, no question.
