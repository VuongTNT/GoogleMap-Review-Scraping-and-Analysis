Just across the road from the abbey and right next to a car park, this café had plenty of outside tables and a clean, pleasant interior with a choice of seating. Loved the Halloween decorations! Very dog friendly. It was busy when I arrived, but the staff could not have been more welcoming and friendly, and I didn't have to wait long for my lunch. Good choice of breakfasts and light meals on the menu, with tempting vegetarian and vegan options, and some delicious looking cakes displayed at the counter. I had limited time and just wanted something quick and light, so I ordered the soup of the day (sweet potato, chilli and coriander) and a homemade cheese scone, with a pot of tea. The soup was piping hot, wonderful blend of flavours without being too spicy. The large scone was very fresh and just melted in my mouth! Generous amount of butter too! Prices were very reasonable given the high quality of the food. Would certainly have lunch here again if I return to Melrose.",

The Eden (Scottish Breakfast) is recommended. Vegetarian options also available. The cafe also serves scones, cakes and other breakfast options as well as main meals later in the day. Hot drinks with the breakfasts but a variety of cold drinks are also available, along with a small selection of alcoholic drinks.\nDogs are welcome in the cafe - There were  couple of dogs when we arrived and also child friendly 👍"
